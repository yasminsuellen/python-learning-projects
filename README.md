# Python Learning Projects

## Introduction
This repository features projects developed throughout my Python learning journey, each designed to strengthen key programming concepts and demonstrate practical applications of Python.

## Projects
- `character-count/` : A script to count the frequency of each character in a given string.
- `common-elements/` : A script to find common elements between two lists of integers.
- `leap-year-check/` : A script to determine if a given year is a leap year.
- `list-intersection/` : A script to find the common elements between two lists of integers, without duplicates.
- `parity-check/` : A script to check if a number is even or odd.
- `vowel-count/` : A script to count the number of vowels in a given string.

## Installation
To run these scripts on your local machine, you'll need to have Python installed. 
- Download Python - [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage
